## Groop 
by Reid Parisi, Siam Abd Al-llah, and Roman Accardi

We are Groop. We are a groop finding app that gives an interface to find likeminded people looking to groop up. This is app is designed flexibly
for user's new to a city that can go on groop to find friends to do things with in their new home or temporary stay, as well as to accomdate
homebodies who want an extra for their board game night, go out on the town, or study for an exam. You'll never be alone again with GROOP.

We can create and join groops of differing categories and view users and groops. You can groop messege your groop to set up the meeting
or messege other users to see if they are your cup of boba. 

You can use Groop by turning on your location services and signing up or using user: solmyr15@gmail.com pass: qwerty. or 
user: romanaccardi@gmail.com pass: grooper

We have created some stock activities and will add more variety in the future. We will also looking to expand to have a map view of activities
and update users to have profiles pictures. As well we will implement a more rigorous sign up process that requires text verification to minizime
bots, trolls, and hagfish. Groop will also later has a friends feature to keep track of your best buddies and have longterm groops that don't occur
at just one time. Groop has a lot of space to grow. 

One bug that has been fixed to our knoledge is the gps services working on the emulator. It has always worked very well on actual phones, but 
used to be buggy. It should be fine now, but make sure you turn on location before using the app and if you are signed in and its not working
sign out then locate yourself then sign in again. Also Groop will implement notifications to messenging with firebase messenging. 

Completed tasks are: sorting by distance and category and some box's have dynamic search. You can view all groops, all users, as well as your groops
and your activites. You can edit and delete groops that you have made and join and leave other's groops. When viewing groops or all users, you can
click on a user to view their activites and their groops. You can messege users and groops to have realtime updates to the chat. You can
update your bio and your location. Your set location is only used for users to search by distance to users. Other distances are taken dynamically.
