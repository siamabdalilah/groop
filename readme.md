## Groop

###Mission Statement

We are Groop. We are a groop finding app that gives an interface to find likeminded people looking to groop up. This is app is designed flexibly
for users new to a city who can go on Groop to find friends to do things with in their new home or temporary stay, as well as to accomdate
homebodies who want an extra for their board game evening, night on the town, or study session. You'll never be alone again with GROOP.

###The Idea

We can create and join groops of differing categories and view users and groops. You can groop message your groop to set up the meeting
or message other users to see if they are your cup of boba.

###Usage instructions

You can use Groop by turning on your location services and signing up or using

user: solmyr15@gmail.com pass: qwerty.

or

user: romanaccardi@gmail.com pass: grooper

###Current and past bugs

One bug that has been fixed to our knowledge is the GPS services working on the emulator. It has always worked very well on actual phones, but 
used to be buggy. It should be fine now, but make sure you turn on location before using the app and, if you are signed in and it's not working,
sign out and locate yourself before signing in again.

An active bug remains in the create groop activity on the emulator, once you click the locate
button it can take a couple seconds to find your location and redirect you. However, if you try to locate again while it is loading if can cause the
app to crash.  We are confident that a small amount of further investigation could resolve this issue, however, we were unable to iron it out before
the due date for this lab.

###Features

Completed tasks are: sorting by groops distance and category; some boxes feature dynamic search. You can view all groops, all users, as well as your groops
and your activites. You can edit and delete groops that you have made and join and leave others' groops. When viewing groops or all users, you can
click on a user to view their activites and their groops. You can messege users and groops to have realtime updates to the chat. You can
update your bio and your location. Your set location is only used for users to search by distance to users. Other distances are taken dynamically.

###Goals for future work

We have created some stock activities and will add more variety in the future. We will also look to add a map view of activities
and update users to have profiles pictures. Additionally, we will implement a more rigorous sign up process that requires text verification to minimize
bots, trolls, and hagfish. Groop will also later has a friends feature to keep track of your best buddies and have longterm groops that don't occur
at just one time. Also, Groop will implement notifications to messenging with firebase messenging.  In other words, although we're very happy with
the product as it stands, Groop has a lot of room to grow throughout future updates and releases.
